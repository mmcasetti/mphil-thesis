## TITLE: the gale string problem for equilibrium computation in games ##

#### IMPORTANT: always explain WHY

#### Ideas

NE --> polytopes --> SC: cyclic --> GALE (*) --> P, via PM
   --> PPAD --> sign/orientation [& (*)] —-> sign of PM/GALE/equilibria

GALE // polytopes in pivoting - not so much! See: mention oik (VvS), but remember that it's not the main point (that's GALE)
