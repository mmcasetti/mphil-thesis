## TITLE: the gale string problem for equilibrium computation in games ##


* more introduction (all concepts well explained)
* This thesis presents a report on an original research result, published in ENDM (year);
this typically would constitute a chapter of a PhD thesis. and related results

IMPORTANT: always explain WHY


NE --> polytopes --> SC: cyclic --> GALE --> P, via PM (*)
   --> PPAD --> sign/orientation [& (*)] —-> sign of PM/GALE/equilibria

GALE // polytopes in pivoting.

Mention oik (VvS), but remember that it's not the main point (that's GALE)

INTRO

* MAIN: matching GALE <--> PM
(Say this first, it's main idea!)
* this result led to further results, on which we report, about SIGN of PM (// index of NE) - started & proven for planar: JM; solved in general: VvS

START

Something less technical - basic definitions & problems

* NE
* polytope
* [use: section 2 SvS, quoted in VvS, section 2, pg 5]


GAME THEORY PART

* copy section 2 in ge (= published in ENDM) (co-author, can do copy-paste)
* improved version of thm 2.1 in ge, in Prop 1 in VvS (general, not just cyclic)
