# The Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract

(See other file)

## Introduction

What, why and overview of tools used

## Bimatrix games and polytopes

Nash Equilibria, Best response polytopes

Polytopes to games (NE can be found via polytopes, polytopes can be used to create games) (vS 1999 - nxn games w/ more than 2^n equilibria)

## Cyclic polytopes and gale strings

Special case: cyclic polytopes.

Cyclic polytopes can be represented w/ a combinatorial structure - Gale strings.

### The Lemke-Howson algorithm and the class PPAD

The Lemke-Howson algorithm

Lemke-Howson for Gale (SvS)

touch on pivoting as one of the reasons to introduce PPA(D). *just give the
def of directed*, the idea of pivoting + sign will be discussed in "further
results" section. The focus is "why the main result is relevant"

mention oiks, so you can later mention that EulG - as the ones used for MAIN
are oik. Again: not too much.


## The complexity of **Completely labeled Gale string** and **Another completely labeled Gale string**

Note: why not call them GALE and ANOTHER GALE? It would make it more readable.

**Main result!** - the reduction to Perfect matching; both GALE and ANOTHER
GALE are in P, we're happy.

## Further results

The framework provided by our result led to further questions, related to the
issue of the *sign* of an index - and so on (Merschen, VvS)

Open problems (?)
