# Complexity of the Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract

(max 300 words)

## Introduction

* why what how - the usual
* PPAD (it won't come back until appendix but it's in the background)

## Games, Polytopes and Gale Strings

### Games and Nash equilibria

* basic definitions: game, NE

### Bimatrix Games and Best Response Polytopes

* Idea: Polytopes to games (NE can be found via polytopes, polytopes can be
used to create games) (vS 1999 - nxn games w/ more than 2^n equilibria)
* see all articles vS & past theses

### Cyclic Polytopes and Gale strings

* def CP
* def GS
* example GS, d even
* exmple GS, d odd
* thm Gale (true for d even and odd!)
* graphics to go w/ thm
* prop even d (use modulo, then find a nice notation & drop it)
* assume that from now on d even (unless o/w spec - if parity thm for odd d
too)

### Labeling and ANOTHER GALE

[labeling in GS and on CP; the problem ANOTHER GALE]

## Algorithms and Complexity Results

### Pivoting

[Path on Gale Strings // Cyclic polytopes - without labels]

### The Lemke-Howson Algorithm and Parity

* almost completely labeled GS
* LH for Gale
* even no of CLGS
- holds for d odd too (?)
- not for GS in general
* examples (by pf thm that GS + label => unique, ex show that converse not true)

Lemke-Howson for Gale // on Poly - we add labels

[A lot of tabulars and graphics! to show running pivoting and LHG between two
(A)CLGS]

[Theorem: if there's a GS, there's another one
* will be used in next section
* will be used to talk about sign in further results
and PPAD in appendix]

PPAD? it goes off topic...

### The complexity of GALE and ANOTHER GALE

* GALE introduced as accessory problem
* PM def
* main thm for GALE
* ex of construction: if there is / there isn't PM
* main theorem for ANOTHER GALE
* ex: double edge / all edges in PM are single / all single edges
