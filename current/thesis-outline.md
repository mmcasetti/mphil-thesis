# The Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract

(See other file)

## Introduction

What, why and overview of tools used

## Basic definitions

### Bimatrix games

Nash Equilibria, Best response polytopes

see section 2 in ENDM article; improved version of thm 2.1 can be found in
Prop 1 in VvS (general, not just cyclic polytopes)

### The Lemke-Howson algorithm

The Lemke-Howson algorithm

### Gale strings

Definition, Lemke-Howson for Gale (SvS)

### Pivoting and the class PPAD

touch on pivoting as one of the reasons to introduce PPA(D). *just give the
def of directed*, the idea of pivoting + sign will be discussed in "further
results" section. The focus is "why the main result is relevant"

mention oiks, so you can later mention that EulG - as the ones used for MAIN
are oik. Again: not too much.

## The complexity of **Completely labeled Gale string** and **Another completely labeled Gale string**

Note: why not call them GALE and ANOTHER GALE? It would make it more readable.

**Main result!** - the reduction to Perfect matching; both GALE and ANOTHER
GALE are in P, we're happy.

## Further results

The framework provided by our result led to further questions, related to the
issue of the *sign* of an index - and so on (Merschen, VvS)

Open problems (?)
