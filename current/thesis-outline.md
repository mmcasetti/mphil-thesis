# Complexity of the Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract

(See other file)

## Introduction

What, why and overview of tools used

Intro to idea of PPAD goes in here

## Games, Polytopes and Gale Strings
[definitions & background]

### Games and Nash equilibria

Notation for games, Nash Equilibria

### Best Response Polytopes

Best response polytopes

Polytopes to games (NE can be found via polytopes, polytopes can be used to create games) (vS 1999 - nxn games w/ more than 2^n equilibria)

### Cyclic Polytopes and Gale strings

Special case: cyclic polytopes.

Cyclic polytopes can be represented w/ a combinatorial structure - Gale strings.

### Labeling and ANOTHER GALE

Labeling, which gives the reason for studying ANOTHER GALE

## Algorithms and Complexity Results
[main results: thms]

### Pivoting

Path on Gale Strings // Cyclic polytopes - without labels

### The Lemke-Howson Algorithm and Parity

Lemke-Howson for Gale // on Poly - we add labels

[A lot of tabulars and graphics! to show running pivoting and LHG between two
(A)CLGS]

[Theorem: if there's a GS, there's another one
* will be used in next section
* will be used to talk about sign in further results
and PPAD in appendix]

PPAD? it goes off topic...

### The complexity of GALE and ANOTHER GALE

GALE introduced as accessory problem,

PERFECT MATCHING

Main theorem on GALE

Main theorem on ANOTHER GALE

[A lot of graphics, please!]

## Further results

The framework provided by our result led to further questions, related to the
issue of the *sign* of an index (Merschen, VvS)

[Graphics of endpoints of LHG on all CLGS for G(d,n)]

Open problems (?)
