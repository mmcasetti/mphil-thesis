This thesis presents a report on original research, published as joint
work with Merschen and von Stengel in {\em Electronic Notes in Discrete
Mathematics}~\cite{main}. Our result shows a polynomial time
algorithm to solve two problems related to labeled Gale strings, a
combinatorial structure introduced by Gale in \cite{gale} that can be
used in the representation of a particular class of games.

These games were used by Savani and von Stengel~\cite{svs}~\cite{uvg} as an
\mbox{example} of exponential running time for the classical \mbox{Lemke-Howson}
algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game~\cite{lh}.
It was conjectured that \mbox{solving} these games via the Lemke-Howson
algorithm was complete in the class {\bf PPAD} (Proof by Parity
Argument, Directed version). A major motivation for the definition of
this class by Papadimitriou~\cite{ppad} was, in turn, to capture
the \mbox{pivoting} technique of many results related to the Nash equilibrium,
\mbox{including} the Lemke-Howson algorithm.

Our result, on the contrary, sets apart this class of games as a case
for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium.
Since Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papaditrimiou~\cite{dgp} and
Chen and Deng~\cite{cd} proved the \mbox{{\bf PPAD}-completeness} of
finding a Nash equilibrium in general normal-form games, we have a special
class of games, unless \mbox{{\bf PPAD} = {\bf P}}.

Our proof exploits two results. The first one is the representation
of the Nash equilibria of these games as Gale strings, as seen in Savani
and von Stengel~\cite{svs}~\cite{uvg}. The second one is the polynomial-time
solvability of the problem of finding a perfect matching in a graph, proven
by Edmonds~\cite{edm}.

Merschen~\cite{jm} and V\'{e}gh and von Stengel~\cite{vvs} expanded our
ideas to prove further results about the index of a Nash
equilibrium, defined in \mbox{Shapley \cite{shapley}}, in the framework of
oiks, introduced by Edmonds~\cite{edm-oiks} and Edmonds and
\mbox{Sanit\`a~\cite{edm-sanita}}.
