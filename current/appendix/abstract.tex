This thesis presents a report on original research, extending a result
published as joint
work with Merschen and von Stengel in {\em Electronic Notes in Discrete
Mathematics}~\cite{main}. We present a polynomial time
algorithm for two problems on labeled Gale strings, a
combinatorial structure
introduced by Gale \cite{gale} that can be
used in the representation of a particular class of games.

These games were used by Savani and von Stengel~\cite{svs} as an
example of exponential running time for the classical
\mbox{Lemke-Howson} algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium of a
bimatrix game~\cite{lh}.
It was therefore conjectured that \mbox{solving} these games was a
complete problem in the class {\bf PPAD} (Polynomial Parity
Argument, Directed version, see Papadimitriou~\cite{ppad}). In turn, a major
motivation for the definition of PPAD was the study of complementary pivoting
methods, such as the Lemke-Howson algorithm.

Our result, unexpectedly, sets apart this class of games as a case
where a Nash equilibrium can be found in polynomial time.
Since Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papaditrimiou~\cite{dgp} and
Chen and Deng~\cite{cd} proved that finding a Nash equilibrium in
general normal-form games is \mbox{{\bf PPAD}-complete}, we have a special
class of games, unless \mbox{{\bf PPAD} = {\bf P}}.

Our proof exploits two results. As seen in Savani
and von Stengel~\cite{svs}~\cite{uvg}, we represent the Nash equilibria
of these special games as Gale strings.
We then give a graph where the perfect matchings correspond
to Nash equilibria via Gale strings, and we exploit Edmonds'
polynomial-time algorithm for a perfect matching in a graph~\cite{edm}.
The proof given in Casetti, Merschen and von Stengel \cite{main}
covered only the case of even-dimensional Gale strings;
here we extend the result to the general case.

Merschen~\cite{jm} and V\'{e}gh and von Stengel~\cite{vvs} expanded on our
ideas, proving further results on the index of Nash equilibria (see
Shapley~\cite{shapley}) in the framework of ``oiks'' introduced by
Edmonds~\cite{edm-oiks} and Edmonds and Sanit\`a~\cite{edm-sanita}.
