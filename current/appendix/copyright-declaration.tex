I certify that this thesis I have presented
for examination for the MPhil degree of the London School of Economics and
Political Science is based on joint work with Julian Merschen and Bernhard
von Stengel, published in \cite{main}.
The improvement given by Proposition \ref{d-even-another-gale} is an
original result.

The copyright of this thesis rests with the author. Quotation from it is
permitted, provided that full acknowledgement is made. This thesis may not
be reproduced without my prior written consent.

I warrant that this authorisation does not, to the best of my belief,
infringe the rights of any third party.
