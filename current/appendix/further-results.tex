\section{Oiks and index}

oiks as in edmonds. lh is exchange on d - 2, lh dual is exchange on d - 1
(or d-1 and d?) oik.

pbl index:

endpoints of LHG have opposite sign (Z graph)
so the graph of "what eq can you reach from eq" is bipartite (not nec connected,
ex in shapley 74)

but - ex octahedron - every rp reachable from each other rp


\section{other results}

\# P complexity of finding all (?)
