\section{Bimatrix Games and Labels}

In the rest of this thesis we will focus bimatrix games.
We will assume that the payoff matrices $(A,B)$ are non-negative,
and that neither $A$ nor $B\T$ has a zero column, if necessary applying
an affine transformation, which does not affect the equilibria of the game.

The Nash equilibria of bimatrix games can be analysed from a combinatorial
point of view using {\em labels}. This method is due to Shapley
\cite{shapley}, in a study building on ideas introduced in a
paper by Lemke and Howson \cite{lh}.
Let $n,m\in\naturals$ with $n\leq m$, and consider a set $X$ with $|X|=m$.
A {\em labeling} of $X$ is a function $l:X\to [n]$. An $n$-uple
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in X^n$ is {\em completely labeled} if
$\{ i\in [n]\ |\ l(x_j)=i\text{ for some }j\in [n] \}=[n]$.

Let $(A,B)$ be bimatrix game, and let $X$ and $Y$ be the mixed strategy
simplices of respectively player 1 and 2; that is
\begin{equation}\label{mixed-strat-simplices}
X = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ \1\T x = 1 \};\quad
Y = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\ \1\T y = 1 \}.
\end{equation}

A {\em labeling} of the game is then given as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the $m$ pure strategies of player 1 are identified by $1,\ldots,m$;
\item the $n$ pure strategies of player 2 are identified by $m+1,\ldots,m+n$;
\item each mixed strategy $x\in X$ of player 1 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that $x_i = 0$, that is if in
    $x$ player 1 does not play her $i$th pure strategy,
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that the $j$th pure strategy
    of player 2 is a best response to $x$;
    \end{itemize}
\item each mixed strategy $y\in Y$ of player 2 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that $y_j = 0$, that is if in
    $y$ player 2 does not play his $j$th pure strategy,
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that the $i$th pure strategy
    of player 1 is a best response to $y$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The labeling of mixed strategy profiles can be used to characterize the
Nash equilibria of the game.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Shapley \cite{shapley})}\label{comp-label-thm}
Let $(x,y)\in X\times Y$; then $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of the bimatrix
game $(A,B)$ if and only if $(x,y)$ is completely labeled.

\begin{proof}
The mixed strategy $x\in X$ has label $m + j$ for some $j\in [n]$ if and
only if the $j$th pure strategy of player 2 is a best response to $x$; this,
in turn, is a necessary and sufficient condition for player 2 to play his
$j$th strategy at an equilibrium against $x$. Therefore, at an equilibrium
$(x,y)$ all labels $m + 1,\ldots,m + n$ will appear either as labels of
$x$ or of $y$. The analogous holds for the labels $i\in [n]$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

An useful graphical representation of labels on the simplices $X$ and $Y$.
is done by labeling the outside of each simplex according to the player's own
pure strategies that are {\em not} played, and by subdividing its interior
in closed polyhedral sets corresponding to the other player's best response,
called {\em best response regions}. We give an example of this construction.

\begin{example}

\todo[inline]{page 3--4 of Savani, von Stengel, Unit Vector Games.

With graphics.}

\end{example}

The point of view of best response regions can be translated to an equivalent
construction of {\em best response polytopes}.
We begin by noticing that the best-response regions can be obtained as
projections on $X$ and $Y$ of the {\em best-response facets} of
the polyhedra
\begin{equation}\label{br-polyhedron}
\bar{P} = \{ (x,v)\in X\times\reals\ |\ B\T x\leq\1 v \};\quad
\bar{Q} = \{ (y,u)\in Y\times\reals\ |\ A y\leq\1 u \}.
\end{equation}

These facets in $\bar{P}$ are defined as the points $(x,v)\in X\times\reals$
such that $(B\T x)_j = v$, which in turn represent the strategies $x\in X$ of
player 1 that give exactly payoff $v$ to player 2 when he plays strategy $j$;
the projection of the facet defined by $(B\T x)_j = v$ to $X$ has then
label $j$. Analogously, the facet of $\bar{Q}$ given by the points
$(y,u)\in Y\times\reals$ such that $(A y)_i = u$ will project to the
best-response region of $Y$ with label $i$.

\begin{example}

\todo[inline]{cont of ex above, page 4--5, image on page 5 left}

\end{example}

Given the assumptions on non-negativity of $A$ and $B\T$, we can give a
change coordinates to $x_i / v$ and $y_j / u$ and replace $\bar{P}$ and
$\bar{Q}$ with the {\em best-response polytopes}
\begin{equation}\label{br-polytopes}
P = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \};\quad
Q = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\ A y\leq\1 \}.
\end{equation}

The polytope $P$ is the intersection of $n+m$ half spaces, one for each
inequality corresponding to either player 1 avoiding her $i$-th pure
strategy, where $i\in [m]$, or to a best response of player 2 that gives
non-zero probability to his $j$-th strategy, where $j\in [n]$.
Formally, a point $x\in P$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$x_k = 0$ for $k\in [m]$ or $(B\T x)_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$.
Analogously, a point in $Q$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$y_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$ or $(A y)_k$ for $k\in [m]$.
Then a point $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled if and only if
it satisfies the {\em complementarity condition}
\begin{eqnarray}
x_i = 0\text{ or }(Ay)_i = 1\text{ for all }i\in [m];\nonumber \\
y_j = 0\text{ or }(B\T x)_j\text{ for all }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}
Then either he point corresponding to $(x,y)$ in $\bar{P}\times\bar{Q}$
is a Nash equilibrium, or $(x,y)=(\0,\0)$; we will refer to the latter case
as {\em artificial equilibrium}.

We note a useful property: any bimatrix game can be ``symmetrized.''
The result is due to Gale, Kuhn and Tucker \cite{gale-kuhn-tucker} for
zero-sum games; its extension to non-zero-sum games is a folklore result.

\begin{proposition}\label{symmetrize-thm}
Let $(A,B)$ be a bimatrix game and $(x,y)$ be one of its Nash equilibria.
Then $(z,z)$, where $z=(x,y)$, is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric game
$(C,C\T)$, where
\begin{equation}
C = \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & A \\
    B\T & 0
    \end{array}
    \right).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky} have proven a converse of
proposition \ref{symmetrize-thm} for bimatrix games of the form $(I,B)$,
called {\em imitiation games}.

\begin{proposition}{\rm (McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky})}
\label{imitation-thm}
The pair $(x,x)$ is a symmetric Nash equilibrium of the symmetric bimatrix
game $(C,C\T)$ if and only if there is some $y$ such that $(x,y)$ is a
Nash equilibrium of the imitation game $(I,C\T)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}

\todo[inline]{ex Savani, von Stengel, pg 8}

\end{example}

A generalization of imitation games is given by {\em unit vector games}.
These are games of the form $(U,B)$, where the columns of the matrix $U$ are
unit vectors. The correspondence between equilibria of a unit vector game
and completely labeled points
\todo{also in thm: vertices, if nondeg}
of a polytope is given by the following
theorem, first proved in dual form by Balthasar \cite{balthasar} and
given here as in Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg})}\cite{uvg}\label{unit-vector-thm}
Let $l:[n]\to [m]$, and let $(U,B)$ be the unit vector game where
$U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$. Let $N_i = \{ j\in [n]\ |\ l(j)=i \}$ for
$i\in [m]$, and consider the polytopes $P^l$ and $Q^l$
\begin{eqnarray}
P^l = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \}; \label{p-l} \\
Q^l = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\
\sum_{\substack{j\in N_i \\ i\in [m]}} y_j\leq 1 \}. \label{q-l}
\end{eqnarray}

Let $l_f$ be the labeling of the facets of $P^l$ defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{facet-labeling-unitv}
x_i\geq 0\text{ has label }i\text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
(B\T x)_j \leq 1\text{ has label }l(j)\text{ for }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}

Then $x\in P^l$ is a completely labeled point
\todo{vertex}
of $P^l\setminus\{\0\}$
if and only if there is some $y\in Q^l$ such that, after scaling,
the pair $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$

\begin{proof}
\todo{check}
Let $P,Q$ be the polytopes associated to the game $(U,B)$ as before.

Let $(x,y)\in P\times Q\setminus\{ \0,\0 \}$ be a Nash equilibrium of
$(U,B)$, therefore completely labeled in $[m + n]$.
Then, if $x_i=0$, then $x$ has label $i\in m$.
If $x_i > 0$ instead, then $y$ has label $i$, therefore $(Uy)_i = 1$,
therefore for some $j\in [n]$ we have $y_j > 0$ and $U_j = e_i$, so $l(j)=i$.
Since $y_j > 0$ and $(x,y)$ is completely labeled, $x\in P$ has label $m+j$,
that is, $(B\T x)_j = 1$, therefore $x\in P^l$ has label $l(j) = i$.
Hence, $x$ is a completely labeled point of $P^l$.

Conversely, let $x\in P^l\setminus \{ \0 \}$ be completely labeled.
If $x_i > 0$, then there is $j\in [m]$ such that $(B\T x) = j$ and
$l(j) = i$, that is, $j\in N_i$. For all $i$ such that $x_i >0 $,
define $y$ as follows: $y_h = 0$ for all $h\in N_i\setminus \{ j \}$,
$y_j = 1$. Then $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} gives a correspondence between the
completely labeled vertices of the polytope $P^l$ and the equilibria
of the unit vector game $(U,B)$, with an ``artificial''
equilibrium corresponding to the vertex $\0$. We will now construct its dual
version given in \cite{balthasar}.
We traslate the polytope $P^l$ as in \ref{p-l} to
$P = \{ x - \1\ |\ x\in P^l \}$, and multiply all payoffs in $B$ by a
constant, if necessary, so that $\0$ is in the interior of $P$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
P & = \{ x + \1\geq\0,\ (x + \1)\T B\leq\1 \} = \\
  & = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ -x_i\leq 1\text{ for }i\in [m],\
    x\T (b_j/(1 - \1\T b_j)) \leq 1\text{ for }j\in [n] \}.
\end{align*}
The polar of $P$ is then
\begin{equation}
P^\Delta = \conv(\{−e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}\ \cup\ \{ \frac{b_j}{1 - \1\T b_j} \})
\end{equation}

Since $P$ is a simple polytope with $\0$ in its interior, $P^\Delta$ is
simplicial, $P^{\Delta\Delta}=P$, and the facets of $P^\Delta$ correspond to
the vertices of $P$ and vice versa. We can then label the vertices
of $P^\Delta$ as the corresponding facets in $P^l$; the completely
labeled facets of $P^\Delta$ will then correspond to the completely
labeled vertices of $P^l$.
In particular, the facet corresponding to $\0$ will be
\begin{equation}\label{f-0}
F_0 = \{ x\in P^\Delta\ |\ -\1\T x = 1 \} = \conv\{ e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}.
\end{equation}
Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} then translates as in the original version
by Balthasar \cite{balthasar}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Balthasar \cite{balthasar})}\label{unit-vector-dual-thm}
Let $Q$ be a labeled $m$-dimensional simplicial polytope with \0 in
its interior and vertices $e_1,\ldots,e_m,c_1,\ldots,c_n$ such that
$F_0 = \conv\{ e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}$ is a facet of $Q$.
Let $(U,B)$ be a unit vector game, with $U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$
for a labeling $l:[n]\to [m]$ and $B = (b_1\ \cdots\ b_n)$ with
$b_j = c_j/(1 + \1\T c_j)$ for $j\in [n]$. Let $l_v$ be a labeling
of the vertices of $Q$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{vert-labeling-unitv}
l_v(-e_i)=i\text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
l_v(c_j)=l(j)\text{ for }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}

Then a facet $F\neq F_0$ of $Q$ with normal vector $v$ is completely
labeled if and only if $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$, where
$x = (v + \1) / (\1\T (v + \1))$
\todo{??? here to end thm}
,
and $x_i = 0$ if and only if $−e_i\in F$ for $i\in [m]$.
Any $j$ so that $c_j$ is a vertex of $F$ represents a pure best reply to $x$;
the mixed strategy $y$ is the uniform distribution on the set of the pure best
replies to $x$.
\end{theorem}

As in theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} we have a correspondence between
completely labeled vertices of $P^l$ and equilibria of the unit vector game
$(U,B)$ with an ``artificial'' equilibrium corresponding to the vertex $\0$,
in theorem \ref{unit-vector-dual-thm} we have a correspondence between
the completely labeled facets of the polytope $Q$
and the equilibria of the unit vector game $(U,B)$
with the ``artificial'' equilibrium corresponding to the
facet $F_0$.
