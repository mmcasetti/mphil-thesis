\section{Bimatrix Games and Labels}
\label{labels-section}

In the rest of this thesis we will focus bimatrix games.
We will assume that the payoff matrices $(A,B)$ are non-negative,
and that neither $A$ nor $B\T$ has a zero column, if necessary applying
an affine transformation, which does not affect the equilibria of the game.

The Nash equilibria of bimatrix games can be analysed from a combinatorial
point of view using {\em labels}. This method is due to Shapley
\cite{shapley}, in a study building on ideas introduced in a
paper by Lemke and Howson \cite{lh}.
Let $n,m\in\naturals$ with $m\leq n$, and consider a set $X$ with $|X|=n$.
A {\em labeling} of $X$ is a function $l:X\to [m]$. An $m$-uple
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_m)\in X^m$ is {\em completely labeled} if
$\{ i\in [m]\ |\ l(x_j)=i\text{ for some }j\in [m] \}=[m]$, that is, if
each label $j\in [m]$ appears once and only once in $(l(x_1),\ldots,l(x_m))$.

Let $(A,B)$ be bimatrix game, and let $X$ and $Y$ be the mixed strategy
simplices of respectively player 1 and 2; that is
\begin{equation}\label{mixed-strat-simplices}
X = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ \1\T x = 1 \};\quad
Y = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\ \1\T y = 1 \}.
\end{equation}

A {\em labeling} of the game is then given as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the $m$ pure strategies of player 1 are identified by $1,\ldots,m$;
\item the $n$ pure strategies of player 2 are identified by $m+1,\ldots,m+n$;
\item each mixed strategy $x\in X$ of player 1 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that $x_i = 0$, that is if in
    $x$ player 1 does not play her $i$th pure strategy,
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that the $j$th pure strategy
    of player 2 is a best response to $x$;
    \end{itemize}
\item each mixed strategy $y\in Y$ of player 2 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that $y_j = 0$, that is if in
    $y$ player 2 does not play his $j$th pure strategy,
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that the $i$th pure strategy
    of player 1 is a best response to $y$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The labeling of mixed strategy profiles can be used to characterize the
Nash equilibria of the game.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Shapley \cite{shapley})}\label{comp-label-thm}
Let $(x,y)\in X\times Y$; then $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of the bimatrix
game $(A,B)$ if and only if $(x,y)$ is completely labeled.

\begin{proof}
The mixed strategy $x\in X$ has label $m + j$ for some $j\in [n]$ if and
only if the $j$th pure strategy of player 2 is a best response to $x$; this,
in turn, is a necessary and sufficient condition for player 2 to play his
$j$th strategy at an equilibrium against $x$. Therefore, at an equilibrium
$(x,y)$ all labels $m + 1,\ldots,m + n$ will appear either as labels of
$x$ or of $y$. The analogous holds for the labels $i\in [n]$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

An useful graphical representation of labels on the simplices $X$ and $Y$.
is done by labeling the outside of each simplex according to the player's own
pure strategies that are {\em not} played, and by subdividing its interior
in closed polyhedral sets corresponding to the other player's best response,
called {\em best response regions}. We give an example of this construction.

\begin{example}
\label{br-game-ex}
Consider the $3\times 3$ game $(A,B)$ with
\begin{equation}
\label{AB}
A = \left(\begin{matrix}1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\
0&0&1\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
B = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 3&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}

The pure strategies of player~1 are labeled as $1,2,3$; the pure strategies
of player~2 are labeled as $4,5,6$.

In the following figures the labels of the strategies will be represented
as circled numbers.
Figure~\ref{br-regions-fig} shows $X$ and $Y$: the exterior is labeled with the
player's own pure strategies where these are not played, so the facet
labeled with a pure strategy is opposite to the vertex where only that pure
strategy is played; the interior is covered by the best response regions,
with labels corresponding to the other player's pure strategies that are in
the best response to the player's own strategy in the region.
For example, the best-response region in $Y$ with label~$1$
is the set of those $(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ so that $y_1\ge y_2$ and
$y_1\ge y_3$.
There is only one pair $(x,y)$
that is completely labeled, namely $x=(\frac13,\frac23,0)$
with labels $3,4,5$ and $y=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ with labels
$1,2,6$, so this is the only Nash equilibrium of the game.

\label{br-regions-fig}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

The point of view of best response regions can be translated to an equivalent
construction of {\em best response polytopes}.
We begin by noticing that the best-response regions can be obtained as
projections on $X$ and $Y$ of the {\em best-response facets} of
the polyhedra
\begin{equation}\label{br-polyhedron}
\bar{P} = \{ (x,v)\in X\times\reals\ |\ B\T x\leq\1 v \};\quad
\bar{Q} = \{ (y,u)\in Y\times\reals\ |\ A y\leq\1 u \}.
\end{equation}

These facets in $\bar{P}$ are defined as the points $(x,v)\in X\times\reals$
such that $(B\T x)_j = v$, which in turn represent the strategies $x\in X$ of
player 1 that give exactly payoff $v$ to player 2 when he plays strategy $j$;
the projection of the facet defined by $(B\T x)_j = v$ to $X$ has then
label $j$. Analogously, the facet of $\bar{Q}$ given by the points
$(y,u)\in Y\times\reals$ such that $(A y)_i = u$ will project to the
best-response region of $Y$ with label $i$.

\begin{example}
In the example \ref{br-game-ex}, the inequalities $B\T x\le\1v$ state
$3x_2\leq v$, $2x_1+2x_2+2x_3\leq v$, $4x_1\leq v$.
Figure~\ref{br-polyhedron-fig} shows the best-response facets of $\bar{P}$ and
their projection to $X$ by ignoring the payoff variable~$v$, which
gives the subdivision of $X$ into best-response regions Figure
\ref{br-regions-fig}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\strut\hfill
\includegraphics[width=45ex]{chapter-1/fig/upenv.pdf}%
\hfill\strut
\caption[Best response facets]{%
Best response facets of the polyhedron $\bar{P}$ in (\ref{br-polyhedron}).
}
\label{br-polyhedron-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

Given the assumptions on non-negativity of $A$ and $B\T$, we can give a
change coordinates to $x_i / v$ and $y_j / u$ and replace $\bar{P}$ and
$\bar{Q}$ with the {\em best-response polytopes}
\begin{equation}\label{br-polytopes}
P = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \};\quad
Q = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\ A y\leq\1 \}.
\end{equation}

The polytope $P$ is the intersection of $n+m$ half spaces, one for each
inequality corresponding to either player 1 avoiding her $i$-th pure
strategy, where $i\in [m]$, or to a best response of player 2 that gives
non-zero probability to his $j$-th strategy, where $j\in [n]$.
Formally, a point $x\in P$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$x_k = 0$ for $k\in [m]$ or $(B\T x)_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$.
Analogously, a point in $Q$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$y_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$ or $(A y)_k$ for $k\in [m]$.
Then a point $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled if and only if
it satisfies the {\em complementarity condition}
\begin{eqnarray}
x_i = 0\text{ or }(Ay)_i = 1\text{ for all }i\in [m];\nonumber \\
y_j = 0\text{ or }(B\T x)_j\text{ for all }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}
Then either he point corresponding to $(x,y)$ in $\bar{P}\times\bar{Q}$
is a Nash equilibrium, or $(x,y)=(\0,\0)$; we will refer to the latter case
as {\em artificial equilibrium}.

\begin{example}
Keeping on with example \ref{br-game-ex}, the polyhedron $\bar{P}$ of
Figure \ref{br-polyhedron-fig} becomes the polytope in Figure \ref{br-polytopes-fig}
\ref{br-polytopes-fig}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption[Best response polytope]{%
Best response polytope $P$ in (\ref{br-polytopes}) for the game in (\ref{AB}).
}
\label{br-polytopes-fig}
\end{figure}

Note that the vertex $(\0,\0)$ has labels $1,2,3$ in $P$ and, analogously,
it has labels $4,5,6$ in $Q$, so it is completely labeled, and corresponds
to the ``artificial'' equilibrium.
\end{example}

We will now see some special cases of games and a series of
polynomial-time reductions that connect them, so that a method that finds
an equilibrium of these games can be used to find an equilibrium of any
arbitrary bimatrix game.

First of all, we focus on symmetric games.
Any bimatrix game can be ``symmetrized''; the result is due to Gale,
Kuhn and Tucker \cite{gale-kuhn-tucker} for zero-sum games; its extension
to non-zero-sum games is a folklore result.

\begin{proposition}\label{symmetrize-c}
Let $(A,B)$ be a bimatrix game and $(x,y)$ be one of its Nash equilibria.
Then $(z,z)$, where $z=(x,y)$, is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric game
$(C,C\T)$, where
\begin{equation}
C = \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & A \\
    B\T & 0
    \end{array}
    \right).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

It takes polynomial time in the size of a matrix to calculate its transpose;
the rest of the reduction from $(A,B)$ to $(C,C\T)$ is linear.
Therefore, we have a reduction from 2-{\sc Nash} to {\sc Symmetric Nash}.

McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky} have proven a result in the
opposite direction of proposition \ref{symmetrize-c}: any symmetric game
can be translated into a bimatrix game of the form $(I,B)$, called
{\em imitiation game}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky})}
\label{imitation-thm}
The pair $(x,x)$ is a symmetric Nash equilibrium of the symmetric bimatrix
game $(C,C\T)$ if and only if there is some $y$ such that $(x,y)$ is a
Nash equilibrium of the imitation game $(I,B)$ with $B=C\T$.
\end{theorem}

Again, the reduction from $(C,C\T)$ takes polynomial time (even better:
linear). So we have a reduction from {\sc Symmetric Nash} to
{\sc Imitation Nash}.

We see now an example illustrating theorem \ref{imitation-thm}.
Note how the mixed strategy $x$ of player 1 in any Nash equilibrium
of $(I,B)$ corresponds exactly to the symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ in
the symmetric game defined by the payoff matrix of player 2.
Note also how theorem \ref{imitation-thm} applies to the symmetric
equilibria of the symmetric game, but not to all its equilibria; there
could be non-symmetric equilibria of $(C,C\T)$ that are not found
through the imitation game.

\begin{example}
As an example, consider the symmetric game $(C,C\T)$ with
\begin{equation}
\label{C}
C = \left(\begin{matrix}0&3&0\\ 2&2&2\\
4&0&0\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
C\T = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 3&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right),
\end{equation}
so that $C\T=B$ in (\ref{AB}), and the corresponding imitation game
$(I,C\T)$ is $(A,B)$ in (\ref{AB}).

Figure~\ref{imit-fig} shows the labeled mixed-strategy simplices $X$ and $Y$
for the game \ref{C}; since the game is symmetric, only the labels
are different.
In addition to the symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ where
$x=(\frac13,\frac23,0)$, the game has two non-symmetric equilibria in $(a,b)$
and $(b,a)$ with $a=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ and $b=(0,\frac23,\frac13)$.

Note that the corresponding imitation game $(A,B)$ has only one
equilibrium in $(x,y)$, where $(x,x)$ is the symmetric equilibrium of
$(C,C\T)$.

\label{imit-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

The characterization of Nash equilibria as completely labeled pairs $(x,y)$
holds for arbitrary bimatrix games. From now on, we will also impose a
further condition: that the games are {\em nondegenerate}
This means that all points in $P$ have at most $m$ labels, and all points in
$Q$ have at most $n$ labels. Therefore, in an equilibrium $(x,y)$ each label
appears exactly once.
This also means that the number of pure best response strategies against a
mixed strategy is never larger than the size of the support of that
mixed strategy.
Geometrically, no point of $P$ lies on more than $m$ facets and no point
of $Q$ lies on more than $n$ facets, so the best response polytopes
$P$ and $Q$ are simple. Furthermore, a point of $P$ has exactly $m$
labels if and only if it is a vertex, and a point of $Q$ has exactly $n$
labels if and only if it is a vertex; therefore, all completely labeled
points $(x,y)$ are vertices, and Nash equilibria are isolated points.

\begin{example}
An example of degenerate game is given by $(C,C\T)$ where
\begin{equation}
\label{Cdeg}
C = \left(\begin{matrix}0&4&0\\ 2&2&2\\
4&0&0\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
C\T = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 4&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
As it is shown in Figure \ref{deg-fig-1}, the game $(C,C\T)$ is degenerate
because the mixed strategy $x=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$, that also defines the
unique symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ of the game, has three pure best
responses.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

\hfill\strut
\caption[A degenerate symmetric game]{%
Best-response regions of the degenerate symmetric game (\ref{Cdeg})
with a unique symmetric equilibrium.
}
\label{deg-fig-1}
\end{figure}

Note that the corresponding equilibria $(x,y)$ of the imitation game
$(I,C\T)$ are not unique, because due to degeneracy any convex
combination of $(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ and $(\frac13,\frac13,\frac13)$
can be chosen for~$y$, as shown in Figure~\ref{deg-fig-2}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

for the degenerate symmetric game (\ref{Cdeg}) where the
equilibria $(x,y)$ are not unique.
}
\label{deg-fig-2}
\end{figure}

This shows how the reduction between symmetric equilibria $(x,x)$ of
a symmetric game and Nash equilibria $(x,y)$ of the corresponding
imitation game as in theorem \ref{imitation-thm} does not preserve
uniqueness if the game is degenerate.
\end{example}

A generalization of imitation games is the class of
{\em unit vector games}, that is games of the form $(U,B)$ where the
columns of the matrix $U$ are unit vectors.
By the results above, finding a Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game is
at least as hard as finding a Nash equilibrium of a unit vector game;
that is, 2-{Nash} reduces to {Unit Vector Nash}.
In unit vector games, the problem of finding a completely labeled vertex
of the polytope $P\times Q$ can be translated into te problem o finding a
completely labeled vertex of one simple polytope that encodes all the game.

The result was due by Balthasar \cite{balthasar} in a different form and
given here as in Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg})}
\label{unit-vector-thm}
Let $l:[n]\to [m]$, and let $(U,B)$ be the unit vector game where
$U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$. Let $N_i = \{ j\in [n]\ |\ l(j)=i \}$ for
$i\in [m]$, and consider the polytopes $P^l$ and $Q^l$
\begin{eqnarray}
P^l = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \}; \label{p-l} \\
Q^l = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\
\sum_{\substack{j\in N_i \\ i\in [m]}} y_j\leq 1 \}. \label{q-l}
\end{eqnarray}

Let $l_f$ be the labeling of the facets of $P^l$ defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{facet-labeling-unitv}
x_i\geq 0\text{ has label }i\text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
(B\T x)_j \leq 1\text{ has label }l(j)\text{ for }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}

Then $x\in P^l$ is a completely labeled vertex of $P^l\setminus\{\0\}$
if and only if there is some $y\in Q^l$ such that, after scaling,
the pair $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$

\begin{proof}
Let $P,Q$ be the polytopes associated to the game $(U,B)$ as before.

Let $(x,y)\in P\times Q\setminus\{ \0,\0 \}$ be a Nash equilibrium of
$(U,B)$, therefore completely labeled in $[m + n]$.
If $x_i=0$, then $x$ has label $i\in m$.
If $x_i > 0$, then $y$ has label $i$, so $(Uy)_i = 1$;
then for some $j\in [n]$ we have $y_j > 0$ and $U_j = e_i$; that is,
we have $y_j > 0$ and $l(j)=i$ for some $j\in [n]$.
Since $y_j > 0$, $x\in P$ has label $m+j$; then, $(B\T x)_j = 1$;s
therefore $x\in P^l$ has label $l(j) = i$.
Hence, $x$ is a completely labeled vertex of $P^l$.

Conversely, let $x\in P^l\setminus \{ \0 \}$ be completely labeled.
If $x_i > 0$, then there is $j\in [m]$ such that $(B\T x) = j$ and
$l(j) = i$, that is, $j\in N_i$. For all $i$ such that $x_i >0 $,
define $y$ as follows: $y_j = 1$;
$y_h = 0$ for all $h\in N_i\setminus \{ j \}$.
Then $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
The game in example \ref{br-game-ex} is a unit vector game, with $l(i)=i$.
In figure \ref{br-polytopes-fig} we have the labels $4,5,6$ on the best
response facets of polytope $P$; the facets with labels $1,2,3$, that is,
the facets where $x_1=0$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=0$, respectively, are at
back right, back left, and bottom of the polytope.
In the polytope $P^l$ the labels $4,5,6$ are replaced by $1,2,3$ because
the corresponding columns of $A$ are the unit vectors $e_1,e_2,e_3$.
Figure~\ref{p-l-fig} shows the polytope $P^l$; the only hidden facet,
with label~$1$, is at the bottom.
Apart from the origin $\0$, the only completely labeled
point of $P^l$ is $x$, as shown in figure \ref{p-l-fig}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

The polytope $P^l$ for the unit vector game (\ref{AB}).
The hidden facet at the back has label~$1$.
}
\label{p-l-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

We will now move on the dual version given of theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm},
as ginve in Balthasar \cite{balthasar}.
We traslate the polytope $P^l$ as in \ref{p-l} to
$P = \{ x - \1\ |\ x\in P^l \}$, and multiply all payoffs in $B$ by a
constant, if necessary, so that $\0$ is in the interior of $P$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
P & = \{ x + \1\geq\0,\ (x + \1)\T B\leq\1 \} = \\
  & = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ -x_i\leq 1\text{ for }i\in [m],\
    x\T (b_j/(1 - \1\T b_j)) \leq 1\text{ for }j\in [n] \}.
\end{align*}
The polar of $P$ is then
\begin{equation}\label{p-l-dual}
P^\Delta = \conv(\{−e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}\ \cup\ \{ c_j\ |\ j\in [n] \})
\end{equation}

with $c_j=b_j/(1 - \1\T b_j)$.
Since $P$ is a simple polytope with $\0$ in its interior, $P^\Delta$ is
simplicial, $P^{\Delta\Delta}=P$, and the facets of $P^\Delta$ correspond to
the vertices of $P$ and vice versa. We can then label the vertices
of $P^\Delta$ as the corresponding facets in $P^l$; the completely
labeled facets of $P^\Delta$ will then correspond to the completely
labeled vertices of $P^l$.
In particular, the facet corresponding to $\0$ will be
\begin{equation}\label{f-0}
F_0 = \{ x\in P^\Delta\ |\ -\1\T x = 1 \} = \conv\{ e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}.
\end{equation}
Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} then translates as in the original version
by Balthasar \cite{balthasar}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Balthasar \cite{balthasar})}\label{unit-vector-dual-thm}
Let $Q$ be a labeled $m$-dimensional simplicial polytope with \0 in
its interior and vertices $e_1,\ldots,e_m,c_1,\ldots,c_n$ such that
$F_0 = \conv\{ e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}$ is a facet of $Q$.
Let $(U,B)$ be a unit vector game, with $U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$
for a labeling $l:[n]\to [m]$ and $B = (b_1\ \cdots\ b_n)$ with
$b_j = c_j/(1 + \1\T c_j)$ for $j\in [n]$. Let $l_v$ be a labeling
of the vertices of $Q$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{vert-labeling-unitv}
l_v(-e_i)=i\text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
l_v(c_j)=l(j)\text{ for }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}

Then a facet $F\neq F_0$ of $Q$ with normal vector $v$ is completely
labeled if and only if $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$, where
$x = (v + \1) / (\1\T (v + \1))$,
so $x_i = 0$ if and only if $−e_i\in F$ for $i\in [m]$,
and the mixed strategy $y$ is the uniform distribution on the set of
the pure best replies to $x$, which in turn correspond to $j\in [n]$
such that $c_j$ is a vertex of $F$.
\end{theorem}

As in theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} we have a correspondence between
completely labeled vertices of $P^l$ and equilibria of the unit vector game
$(U,B)$ with an ``artificial'' equilibrium corresponding to the vertex $\0$,
in theorem \ref{unit-vector-dual-thm} we have a correspondence between
the completely labeled facets of the polytope $Q$
and the equilibria of the unit vector game $(U,B)$
with the ``artificial'' equilibrium corresponding to the
facet $F_0$.

Given a bimatrix nondegenerate game $(A,B)$, it takes polynomial time
to write and solve the linear equations defining its best response polyhedra
$\bar{P},\bar{Q}$ and its best response polytopes $P,Q$.
It also take polynomial time to label $\bar{P},\bar{Q}$ and $P,Q$.
Analogously, given a unit vector game $(U,B)$, it takes polynomial time
to construct and label the polytope $P^l$.
Therefore, by theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm}, we have a polynomial time
reduction from the problem 2-{\sc Nash} for nondegenerate games to the
problem {\sc Another Completely Labeled Vertex}, defined as follows.

\begin{fctproblem}
{Another Completely Labeled Vertex}
{A simple $m$-dimensional polytope $P$ with $m+n$ facets;
a labeling $l_f:[m+n]\to [n]$;
a facet $F_0$ of $P$, completely labeled by $l_f$.}
{A facet $F\neq F_0$ of $S$, completely labeled by $l$.}
\end{fctproblem}

\begin{proposition}
\label{2nash-to-aclv}
The problem {\sc Nondegenerate 2-Nash} reduces in polynomial time to
{\sc Another Completely Labeled Vertex}.
\end{proposition}

Theorem \ref{unit-vector-dual-thm} gives the dual of proposition
\ref{2nash-to-aclv}; since the construction of the polar polytope from
the original one is also polynomial, the reduction is to the problem
{\sc Another Completely Labeled Facet}.

\begin{fctproblem}
{Another Completely Labeled Facet}
{A simplicial $m$-dimensional polytope $Q$ with $m+n$ vertices;
a labeling $l_v:[m+n]\to [n]$;
