This chapter consists of some background definitions and notation that will
be used throughout the thesis. The first section will cover polytopes
(see Ziegler~\cite{ziegler} for further details); the second section will
deal with basic game theory. We will finally focus on computational
complexity; after the standard definitions (see
Papadimitriou~\cite{papad-cc} for an introduction) we will move on to
the more recently defined classes {\bf TFNP} and {\bf PPAD}, first
introduced in \cite{megiddo-papad} and \cite{ppad}, respectively.
The latter, in particular, is a key concept in the study of the problems
that are the focus of this thesis.

We will often need to refer to subsets of $\naturals$; we follow the
notation $[n]=\{ i\in\naturals\ |\ 1\leq i\leq n \}$.
