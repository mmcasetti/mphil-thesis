\section{Normal Form Games and Nash Equilibria}

A {\em finite normal-form game} $\Gamma=(P,S,u)$,
where $S=\times_{p\in P} S_p$ and $u=\times_{p\in P} u^p$, and both
$P$ and $S$ are finite,
is a model of a strategic interaction.
Each {\em player} $p\in P$ chooses a probability distribution
$x^p=(x_1,\ldots,x_{|S_p|})$ over a set of {\em strategies} $s^p\in S_p$.
Since $x^p$ is a probability distribution, we have $x_s^p\geq 0$ and
$\sum_{s} x_s^p$ for every $p\in P$ and $s\in S_p$.
If $x_s^p = 0$ for every strategy $s^p$ but $\bar{s}^p$, the strategy
$x^p$ is the {\em pure strategy} $\bar{s}^p$; otherwise, $x^p$ is a
{\em mixed strategy}.
The {\em strategy profile} $(x^1,\ldots,x^{|P|})$ influences the
{\em payoff} $u^p: S\to\reals$ of each player $p$. For each player
$p$ we denote the set of strategy profiles of all his
opponents as $S_{-p}=\times_{q\neq p} x_s^q$, and for $s\in S_{-p}$ we
denote

\todo[inline]{(what exactly is this?!) as $x_s=\prod_{q\neq p} x_{s_q}^q$}

A {\em Nash equilibrium} of a game is a strategy profile in which each
player cannot improve his expected payoff by unilaterally changing his
strategy. Formally, a Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile $x$ such that
for every $p\in P$ and every $s_i^p,s_j^p\in S_p$
\[
\sum_{s\in S_{-p}} u^p(s_i^p,s) x_s > \sum_{s\in S_{-p}} u^p(s_j^p,s) x_s
\Rightarrow
x_j^p = 0
\]

The existence of a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed by the following theorem
by Nash (\cite{nash}).

\begin{theorem}\label{nash-thm}(Nash, \cite{nash})
Every finite game in normal form has a Nash equilibrium.
\end{theorem}
