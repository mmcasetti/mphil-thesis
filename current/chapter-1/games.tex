\section{Normal Form Games and Nash Equilibria}

We now give the game-theoretic background that will be used in this thesis.
A {\em game}, as first defined by von Neumann in \cite{vnm28}, is a model
of strategic interaction. A {\em finite normal form game} is
$\Gamma=(P,S,u)$ with $S=\times_{p\in P} S_p$ and $u=\times_{p\in P}u^p$
where both the set of {\em players} $P$ and the set of
{\em pure strategies} $S_p$ for every player $p\in P$, and therefore the set
of {\em pure strategy profiles} $S$, are finite. We will use the
notation $S_{-p}=\times{q\neq p}S_p$.
The purpose of each player $p\in P$ is to maximize her {\em payoff function}
$u^p:S\to\reals$. In the following pages, by ``game'' we will always mean
``finite normal form game.'' If there are only two players, we will refer to
player 1 using feminine pronouns and to player 2 using masculine ones.
Such games are called {\em bimatrix games} since they can be characterized by
the $m \times n$ payoff matrices $A$ and $B$, where $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ are
the payoffs of player 1 and 2 when the former plays her $i$th pure strategy
and the latter plays his $j$th pure strategy. A bimatrix game is
{\em zero-sum} if $B=-A$, and {\em symmetric} if  $B=A\T$.

A {\em mixed strategy} of player $p$ is a probability
distribution on $S_P$; it can be described as a point
$x=(x^p_1,\ldots,x^p_{|S_p|})$ on the
$(|S_p|-1)$-dimensional {\em mixed strategy simplex} $\Delta_p$;
the {\em mixed strategy profiles} will be the simplicial polytope
$\Delta=\times_{p\in P}\Delta_p$.
We extend the payoff functions as $u^p:\Delta\to\reals$ by linearity.

A {\em Nash equilibrium} of a game is a strategy profile in which each
player cannot improve his expected payoff by unilaterally changing her
strategy. Such a strategy is called {\em best response strategy} (or simply
{\em best response}); a strategy that is not a best response is called
{\em dominated}.
Formally: for $s\in S_{-p}$ let $x_s=\prod_{q\neq p} x^q_{s_q}$;
then a Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile
$x$ such that for every $p\in P$ and every $\sigma,\tau\in S_p$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{s\in S_{-p}} u^p(\sigma,s) x_s > \sum_{s\in S_{-p}} u^p(\tau,s) x_s
\quad
\Rightarrow
\quad
x_\tau^p = 0
\end{equation}

The existence of a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed by the fundamental theorem
by Nash (\cite{nash}).

\begin{theorem}\label{nash-thm}
Every finite game in normal form has a Nash equilibrium.
\end{theorem}

We give a classic example of game: matching pennies.

\begin{example}
In the $n\times n$ bimatrix game {\em generalized matching pennies}, both
players have payoff zero unless they pay the same strategy. In this case,
player 1 (the {\em pursuer}) has payoff $1$ and player 2 (the \emph{evader}),
has payoff $-1$. If $n=2$ the game (called simply {\em matching pennies}) is

\begin{center}
\def\mm#1{\makebox(0,0){\strut#1}}
\bimatrixgame{3mm}{2}{2}{{{\scriptsize pursuer}}}{{{\scriptsize evader}}}
{{{\scriptsize head}}{{\scriptsize tail}}}
{{\scriptsize head}{\scriptsize tail}}
{
\payoffpairs{1}{{1}0}{{-1}0}
\payoffpairs{2}{0{1}}{0{-1}}
}
\end{center}

At the unique equilibrium of generalised matching pennies, each player
follows the uniform distribution over their strategies.
\end{example}


Consider the problem $n$-{\sc Nash}, as follows.

\begin{fctproblem}
{$n$-Nash}
{A $n$-player game $\Gamma$.}
{A Nash equilibrium of $\Gamma$.}
\end{fctproblem}

By theorem \ref{nash-thm}, {\sc $n$-Nash} is a total function
problem; Megiddo and Papadimitriou (\cite{megiddo-papad}) proved that it is
in {\bf TFNP}. Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papadimitriou \cite{dgp} and Chen
and Deng \cite{cd} have proven its {\bf PPAD}-completeness, the former for
$n\geq 3$ and the latter for $n\geq 2$.

\begin{theorem}\label{nash-ppad-complete}
For $n\geq 2$, the problem {\sc $n$-Nash} is {\bf PPAD}-complete.
\end{theorem}
