\section{Bimatrix Games and Labels}
\label{labels-section}

Let $n,m\in\naturals$ with $m\leq n$.
A {\em labeling} of a set $X$ is a function $l:X\to [m]$; an $n$-uple
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in X^n$ is {\em completely labeled} if
each label $j\in [m]$ appears once and only once in $(l(x_1),\ldots,l(x_n))$;
formally, if $\{ j\in [m]\ \mid\ l(x_i)=j\text{ for some }i\in [n] \}=[m]$.

Let $(A,B)$ be bimatrix game, and let $X$ and $Y$ be the mixed strategy
simplices of respectively player 1 and 2, that is
\begin{equation}\label{mixed-strat-simplices}
X = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ x\geq\0,\ \1\T x = 1 \};\quad
Y = \{ y\in\reals^n\ |\ y\geq\0,\ \1\T y = 1 \}.
\end{equation}
A {\em labeling} of the game is then given as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the $m$ pure strategies of player 1 are identified by $1,\ldots,m$;
\item the $n$ pure strategies of player 2 are identified by $m+1,\ldots,m+n$;
\item each mixed strategy $x\in X$ of player 1 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that $x_i = 0$, that is if in
    $x$ player 1 does not play her $i$-th pure strategy,
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that the $j$-th pure strategy
    of player 2 is a best response to $x$;
    \end{itemize}
\item each mixed strategy $y\in Y$ of player 2 has
    \begin{itemize}
    \item label $m + j$ for each $j\in [n]$ such that $y_j = 0$, that is if in
    $y$ player 2 does not play his $j$-th pure strategy,
    \item label $i$ for each $i\in [m]$ such that the $i$-th pure strategy
    of player 1 is a best response to $y$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The labeling of mixed strategy profiles can be used to characterize the
Nash equilibria of the game.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Shapley \cite{shapley})}\label{comp-label-thm}
Let $(x,y)\in X\times Y$; then $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of the bimatrix
game $(A,B)$ if and only if $(x,y)$ is completely labeled.

\begin{proof}
The mixed strategy $x\in X$ has label $m + j$ for some $j\in [n]$ if and
only if the $j$-th pure strategy of player 2 is a best response to $x$; by
Proposition \ref{br-played-thm} is a necessary and sufficient condition for
player 2 to play his $j$-th strategy at every equilibrium where player 1
chooses $x$. The analogous holds for the strategies $y\in Y$ and player 1
playing her $i$-th strategy in response to player 2 choosing $y$.
Therefore, at an equilibrium $(x,y)$ all labels $m + j$, with $j\in [n]$,
will appear either as labels of $x$ or of $y$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

An useful graphical representation of labels on the simplices $X$ and $Y$
is done by labeling the outside of each simplex according to the player's own
pure strategies that are {\em not} played, and by subdividing its interior
in closed polyhedral sets corresponding to the other player's pure
best response strategies, called {\em best response regions}.
We give an example of this construction.

\begin{example}
\label{br-game-ex}
Consider the $3\times 3$ game $(A,B)$ with
\begin{equation}
\label{AB}
A = \left(\begin{matrix}1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\
0&0&1\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
B = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 3&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{br-regions-fig} shows the mixed strategy simplices $X$ and $Y$:
the exterior facets are labeled with the pure strategy on the opposite
vertex, where only that pure strategy is played; the interior is covered
by the best response regions, labeled by to the other player's pure best
response strategies.
For example, the best-response region in $Y$ with label~$1$
is the set of those $(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ so that $y_1\ge y_2$ and
$y_1\ge y_3$.
There is only one pair $(x,y)$
that is completely labeled, namely $x=(\frac13,\frac23,0)$
with labels $3,4,5$ and $y=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ with labels
$1,2,6$, so this is the only Nash equilibrium of the game.

\label{br-regions-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

The representation of the game and its Nash equilibria in terms of best
response regions can be translated to an equivalent construction on
polytopes.
The first step is to notice that the best-response regions can be obtained as
projections on $X$ and $Y$ of the {\em best-response facets} of
the polyhedra
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{P} = \{ (x,v)\in X\times\reals\ |\ B\T x\leq\1 v \}; \nonumber \\
\overline{Q} = \{ (y,u)\in Y\times\reals\ |\ A y\leq\1 u \}. %
\label{br-polyhedron}
\end{eqnarray}
In $\overline{P}$, these facets are the points $(x,v)\in X\times\reals$
such that $(B\T x)_j = v$, which in turn correspond to the strategies
$x\in X$ of player 1 that give exactly payoff $v$ to player 2 when
he plays strategy $j$; the projection of the facet defined by
$(B\T x)_j = v$ to $X$ has then label $j$.
Analogously, the facet of $\overline{Q}$ given by the points
$(y,u)\in Y\times\reals$ such that $(A y)_i = u$ projects to the
best-response region of $Y$ with label $i$.


\begin{example}
In Example \ref{br-game-ex}, the inequalities $B\T x\le\1v$ are
\begin{eqnarray*}
3x_2 & \leq v; \\
2x_1+ 2x_2+ 2x_3 & \leq v \\
4x_1 & \leq v.
\end{eqnarray*}
Figure~\ref{br-polyhedron-fig} shows the best-response facets of
$\overline{P}$ and their projection to $X$ by ignoring the payoff
variable~$v$, which gives the subdivision of $X$ into best-response
regions of Figure \ref{br-regions-fig}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\strut\hfill
\includegraphics[width=45ex]{chapter-2/fig-labels/upenv.pdf}%
\hfill\strut
\caption[Best response facets]{%
The best response polyhedron $\overline{P}$ of game (\ref{AB}).}
\label{br-polyhedron-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

Given the assumptions on non-negativity of $A$ and $B\T$, we can
change coordinates to $x_i / v$ and $y_j / u$ and replace $\overline{P}$ and
$\overline{Q}$ with the {\em best-response polytopes}
\begin{eqnarray}
P = \{ x\in\reals^m\ \mid\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \}; \nonumber \\
Q = \{ y\in\reals^n\ \mid\ y\geq\0,\ A y\leq\1 \}. \label{br-polytopes}
\end{eqnarray}
The polytope $P$ is the intersection the $m+n$ half spaces
corresponding to either player 1 avoiding her $i$-th pure
strategy or a best response of player 2 that gives
non-zero probability to his $j$-th strategy, where $i\in [m]$ and $j\in [n]$.
Formally, a point $x\in P$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$x_k = 0$ for $k\in [m]$ or $(B\T x)_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$, and
a point in $Q$ has label $k$ if and only if either
$y_k = 0$ for $k\in [n]$ or $(A y)_k$ for $k\in [m]$.
Then a point $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled if and only if
it satisfies the {\em complementarity condition}
\begin{eqnarray}
x_i = 0 & \text{ or }(Ay)_i = 1\quad & \text{ for all }i\in [m];\nonumber \\
y_j = 0 & \text{ or }(B\T x)_j\quad & \text{ for all }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, if $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled, either the
corresponding point in $\overline{P}\times\overline{Q}$
is a Nash equilibrium, or $(x,y)=(\0,\0)$; we will refer to the latter case
as {\em artificial equilibrium}.

\begin{example}
Keeping on with Example \ref{br-game-ex}, the best response
polyhedron $\overline{P}$ of Figure \ref{br-polyhedron-fig} becomes
the best response polytope of Figure \ref{br-polytopes-fig}.
Notice that the vertex $(\0,\0)$ is completely labeled, since it is labeled
by the labels $x_k=0$ with $k=1,2,3$ in $P$ and $k=4,5,6$ in $Q$.

\end{example}

We will now see some special cases of games connected by
polynomial-time reductions.
First of all, we note that any bimatrix game can be ``symmetrized'';
the result is due to Gale, Kuhn and Tucker \cite{gale-kuhn-tucker}
for zero-sum games and its extension to non-zero-sum games is a folklore
result.

\begin{proposition}\label{symmetrize-c}
Let $(A,B)$ be a bimatrix game and let $(x,y)$ be one of its Nash equilibria.
Then $(z,z)$, where $z=(x,y)$, is a Nash equilibrium of the symmetric game
$(C,C\T)$, where
\begin{equation}
C = \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & A \\
    B\T & 0
    \end{array}
    \right).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky} have proven a result in the
opposite direction of Proposition \ref{symmetrize-c}: any symmetric game
can be translated into a bimatrix game $(I,B)$; games of this kind are called
{\em imitiation games}.
Since it takes polynomial time in the size of a matrix to calculate its
transpose, we have a polynomial-time reduction from 2-{\sc Nash} to
{\sc Imitation Nash}.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (McLennan and Tourky \cite{mclennan-tourky})}
\label{imitation-thm}
The pair $(x,x)$ is a symmetric Nash equilibrium of the symmetric bimatrix
game $(C,C\T)$ if and only if there is some $y$ such that $(x,y)$ is a
Nash equilibrium of the imitation game $(I,B)$ with $B=C\T$.
\end{theorem}

In any Nash equilibrium of $(I,B)$, the mixed strategy $x$
of player 1 corresponds exactly to the symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ in
the symmetric game defined by the payoff matrix of player 2.
Note, though, that Theorem \ref{imitation-thm} applies to the symmetric
equilibria of the symmetric game but not to all its Nash equilibria; there
could be non-symmetric equilibria of $(C,C\T)$ that are not found
through the imitation game, as shown in the following example.

\begin{example}
As an example, consider the symmetric game $(C,C\T)$ with
\begin{equation}
\label{C}
C = \left(\begin{matrix}0&3&0\\ 2&2&2\\
4&0&0\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
C\T = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 3&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right),
\end{equation}
so that the corresponding imitation game is $(I,C\T)=(A,B)$, of
Example \ref{br-game-ex}.
Figure~\ref{imit-fig} shows the labeled mixed-strategy simplices $X$ and $Y$
for the game (\ref{C}); since the game is symmetric, only the labels
are different.
In addition to the symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ where
$x=(\frac13,\frac23,0)$, the game has two non-symmetric equilibria in $(a,b)$
and $(b,a)$ with $a=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ and $b=(0,\frac23,\frac13)$;
the imitation game $(A,B)$ has only one equilibrium $(x,y)$,
with $y=(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},0)$, corresponding to $(x,x)$.
\begin{figure}[hbt]

\end{figure}
\end{example}

The characterization of Nash equilibria as completely labeled pairs $(x,y)$
holds for arbitrary bimatrix games. From now on, we will impose a
further condition: all points in $P$ will have at most $m$ labels,
and all points in $Q$ have at most $n$ labels. These games are called
{\em nondegenerate}; since any game can be made nondegenerate by
lexicographic perturbation (see von Stengel \cite{vs-agt}), we can impose
the nondegeneracy condition without loss of generality.
In an equilibrium $(x,y)$ of a nondegenerate game each label appears
exactly once; this also means that the number of pure best response
strategies against a mixed strategy is never larger than the size of
the support of that mixed strategy.
Geometrically, this means that no point of the best response polytope $P$
lies on more than $m$ facets and no point of the best response polytope $Q$
lies on more than $n$ facets, so both $P$ and $Q$ are simple.
Furthermore, a point of
$P$ has exactly $m$ labels if and only if it is a vertex, and a point
of $Q$ has exactly $n$ labels if and only if it is a vertex; therefore,
all completely labeled points $(x,y)$ are vertices of the best response
polytopes, and Nash equilibria are isolated points.

\begin{example}
An example of degenerate game is given by $(C,C\T)$ where
\begin{equation}
\label{Cdeg}
C = \left(\begin{matrix}0&4&0\\ 2&2&2\\
4&0&0\end{matrix}\right),
\qquad
C\T = \left(\begin{matrix}0&2&4\\ 4&2&0\\
0&2&0\end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
As it is shown in Figure \ref{deg-fig} left, the mixed strategy
$x=(\frac12,\frac12,0)$, that also defines the
unique symmetric equilibrium $(x,x)$ of the game, has three pure best
responses.
Notice that the Nash equilibria $(x,y)$ of the imitation game
$(I,C\T)$ are not unique, since any convex
combination of $(\frac12,\frac12,0)$ and $(\frac13,\frac13,\frac13)$
can be chosen for~$y$, as shown in Figure~\ref{deg-fig} right.

A generalization of imitation games is the class of
{\em unit vector games}, introduced by Balthasar \cite{balthasar};
they are defined as bimatrix games of the form $(U,B)$ where the
columns of the matrix $U$ are unit vectors.
By the results above, finding a Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game is
at least as hard as finding a Nash equilibrium of a unit vector game;
that is, 2-{\sc Nash} reduces to {\sc Unit Vector Nash}.
Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg} have shown that in unit vector games
the problem of finding a completely labeled vertex of the product of the
best response polytopes $P\times Q$ can be simplified to the problem of
finding a completely labeled vertex of one polytope that encodes all the
game.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Savani and von Stengel \cite{uvg})}
\label{unit-vector-thm}
Let $l:[n]\to [m]$ be a labeling, and let $(U,B)$ be the unit vector game with
$U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$. Let $N_i = \{ j\in [n]\ \mid\ l(j)=i \}$ for
$i\in [m]$, and consider the polytopes $P^l$ and $Q^l$
\begin{eqnarray}
P^l = \{ x\in\reals^m\ \mid\ x\geq\0,\ B\T x\leq\1 \}; \label{p-l} \\
Q^l = \{ y\in\reals^n\ \mid\ y\geq\0,\
\sum_{\substack{j\in N_i \\ i\in [m]}} y_j\leq 1 \}. \label{q-l} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Let $l_f$ be the labeling of the facets of $P^l$ defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
x_i\geq 0 & \text{ has label }i & \text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
(B\T x)_j \leq 1 & \text{ has label }l(j) & \text{ for }j\in [n]. \label{facet-labeling-unitv}
\end{eqnarray}

Then $x\in P^l$ is a completely labeled vertex of $P^l\setminus\{\0\}$
if and only if there is some $y\in Q^l$ such that, after scaling,
the pair $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$

\begin{proof}
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the best response polytopes of $(U,B)$ as
in (\ref{br-polytopes}),
and let $(x,y)\in P\times Q\setminus\{ (\0,\0) \}$ be a Nash equilibrium of
$(U,B)$; then $(x,y)$ is completely labeled in $[m + n]$. If
$x_i=0$, then $x$ has label $i\in m$;
if $x_i > 0$, then $y$ has label $i$, so $(Uy)_i = 1$;
therefore for some $j\in [n]$ we have $y_j > 0$ and $U_j = e_i$; that is,
we have $y_j > 0$ and $l(j)=i$ for some $j\in [n]$.
Since $y_j > 0$, $x\in P$ has label $m+j$; then, $(B\T x)_j = 1$;
therefore $x\in P^l$ has label $l(j) = i$.
Hence, $x$ is a completely labeled vertex of $P^l$.

Conversely, let $x\in P^l\setminus \{ \0 \}$ be completely labeled.
If $x_i > 0$, then there is $j\in [n]$ such that $(B\T x) = j$ and
$l(j) = i$; that is, $j\in N_i$. For all $i\in [m]$ such that $x_i > 0$,
define $y$ as follows: $y_j = 1$;
$y_h = 0$ for all $h\in N_i\setminus \{ j \}$.
Then $(x,y)\in P\times Q$ is completely labeled.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
The game in Example \ref{br-game-ex} is a unit vector game with $l(i)=i$.
In the polytope $P^l$ of Figure~\ref{p-l-fig} the labels 4, 5 and 6 of the
best response polytope $P$ of Figure \ref{br-polytopes-fig}
are replaced by 1, 2 and 3, since the corresponding columns of $A$
are the unit vectors $e_1,e_2,e_3$.
The only completely labeled point of $P^l$ are the origin $\0$, corresponding
to the ``artificial'' equilibrium, and $x$, corresponding to the unique
Nash equilibrium of the unit vector game (\ref{AB}).

}
\label{p-l-fig}
\end{figure}
\end{example}

We will now move on the dual version of Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm},
as given by Balthasar \cite{balthasar}.
We can traslate the polytope $P^l$ of (\ref{p-l}) to
$P = \{ x - \1\ |\ x\in P^l \}$, multiplying all payoffs in $B$ by a
constant, if necessary, so that $\0$ is in the interior of $P$.
We have that
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{P}   & = \{ x + \1\geq\0,\ (x + \1)\T B\leq\1 \} = \\
                & = \{ x\in\reals^m\ |\ -x_i\leq 1\text{ for }i\in [m],\
    x\T (b_j/(1 - \1\T b_j)) \leq 1\text{ for }j\in [n] \}.
\end{align*}
The polar of $\widetilde{P}$ is then
\begin{equation}\label{p-l-dual}
Q = \widetilde{P}^\Delta = \conv(\{−e_i\ |\ i\in [m] \}\ %
                                \cup\ \{ c_j\ |\ j\in [n] \})
\end{equation}
where $c_j=b_j/(1 - \1\T b_j)$.
Since $\widetilde{P}$ is a simple polytope with $\0$ in its interior,
$Q^\Delta=\widetilde{P}^{\Delta\Delta}=\widetilde{P}$. Furthermore,
$Q$ is simplicial and its facets correspond to the vertices of $P$
and vice versa.
We label the vertices
of $Q$ as the corresponding facets in $P^l$, so the completely
labeled facets of $Q$ correspond to the completely
labeled vertices of $P^l$.
In particular, the facet corresponding to $\0$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
F_0 & = & \{ x\in \widetilde{P}^\Delta\ \mid\ -\1\T x = 1 \} \nonumber \\
    & = & \conv\{ e_i\ \mid\ i\in [m] \}. \label{f-0}
\end{eqnarray}
Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} then translates into the following.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Balthasar \cite{balthasar})}
\label{unit-vector-dual-thm}
Let $Q$ be a labeled $m$-dimensional simplicial polytope with \0 in
its interior and vertices $e_1,\ldots,e_m,c_1,\ldots,c_n$ such that
(\ref{f-0}) is a facet of $Q$.
Let $(U,B)$ be a unit vector game, with $U=(e_{l(1)}\ \cdots\ e_{l(n)})$
for a labeling $l:[n]\to [m]$ and $B = (b_1\ \cdots\ b_n)$, where
$b_j = c_j/(1 + \1\T c_j)$ for $j\in [n]$. Let $l_v$ be the labeling
of the vertices of $Q$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{vert-labeling-unitv}
l_v(-e_i)=i & \text{ for }i\in [m]; \nonumber \\
l_v(c_j)=l(j) & \text{ for }j\in [n].
\end{eqnarray}

Then a facet $F\neq F_0$ of $Q$ with normal vector $v$ is completely
labeled if and only if $(x,y)$ is a Nash equilibrium of $(U,B)$, where
$x = (v + \1) / (\1\T (v + \1))$, so that
$x_i = 0$ if and only if $−e_i\in F$ for $i\in [m]$
and the mixed strategy $y$ is the uniform distribution on the set of
the pure best replies to $x$, which in turn correspond to all $j\in [n]$
such that $c_j$ is a vertex of $F$.
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} gives a correspondence between
completely labeled vertices of $P^l$ and equilibria of the unit vector game
$(U,B)$ with the ``artificial'' equilibrium corresponding to the vertex $\0$;
Theorem \ref{unit-vector-dual-thm} gives a correspondence between
completely labeled facets of $Q$
and equilibria of $(U,B)$ with the ``artificial'' equilibrium
corresponding to the facet $F_0$ in (\ref{f-0}).

Given a bimatrix game $(A,B)$, it takes polynomial time
to write and solve the linear equations defining its best response polyhedra
$\overline{P},\overline{Q}$ and its best response polytopes $P,Q$.
It also take polynomial time to label $\overline{P},\overline{Q}$ and $P,Q$.
Analogously, given a unit vector game $(U,B)$, it takes polynomial time
to construct and label the polytope $P^l$.
Therefore, Theorem \ref{unit-vector-thm} implies a polynomial time
reduction from the problem 2-{\sc Nash} to the
problem {\sc Another Completely Labeled Vertex}.

\begin{problem}
{Another Completely Labeled Vertex}
{A $m$-dimensional simple polytope $P$ with $m+n$ facets;
a labeling $l_f:[m+n]\to [n]$;
a vertex $v_0$ of $P$ that is completely labeled by $l_f$.}
{A vertex $v\neq v_0$ of $P$ that is completely labeled by $l_s$.}
\end{problem}

\begin{proposition}
\label{2nash-to-aclv}
{\sc 2-Nash} reduces in polynomial time to
{\sc Another Completely Labeled Vertex}.
\end{proposition}

Theorem \ref{unit-vector-dual-thm} gives the dual of Proposition
\ref{2nash-to-aclv}; since the construction of the polar polytope from
the original one is also polynomial, the reduction is to the problem
{\sc Another Completely Labeled Facet}.

\begin{problem}
{Another Completely Labeled Facet}
{A simplicial $m$-dimensional polytope $Q$ with $m+n$ vertices;
a labeling $l_v:[m+n]\to [n]$;
a facet $F_0$ of $Q$ that is completely labeled by $l_v$.}
{A facet $F\neq F_0$ of $Q$ that is completely labeled by $l_v$.}
\end{problem}

\begin{proposition}
\label{2nash-to-aclf}
{\sc 2-Nash} reduces in polynomial time to
{\sc Another Completely Labeled Facet}.
\end{proposition}
