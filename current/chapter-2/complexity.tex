\todo[inline]{complexity of LH algorithms

oiks as in edmonds (mention).

lh is exchange on d - 2, lh dual is exchange on d - 1
(or d-1 and d?) oik.

pbl index (that gives PPA vs PPAD):

endpoints of LHG have opposite sign (Z graph)
so the graph of "what eq can you reach from eq" is bipartite (not nec connected,
ex in shapley 74)

but - ex octahedron - every rp reachable from each other rp
