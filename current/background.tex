A {\em computational problem} is given by the combination of an {\em input}
and a related {\em output}. A specific input gives an {\em instance} of the
problem.

\todo[inline]{complement of a problem - needed for co-NP}

Computational problems can be classified according to the form of their
output. A {\em decision problems} outputs either ``YES'' or ``NO''. An
instance $x$ {\em function problem}, on the other hand, returns a more
generic output $y$ that satisfies a given relation $R(x,y)$.

{\em Search problems} are function problems that return either an output
$y$ satisfying a given relation $R(x,y)$ or ``NO'', if it's not possible to
find any such $y$. If $y$ is guaranteed to exist, the problem is called a
{\em total function problem}. {\em Counting problems}, finally, return the
{\em number} of $y$'s that satisfy $R(x,y)$; given a problem $R$ we denote
the associated counting problem $\# R$.

An example of decision problem is: ``(input) given a graph, (question)
is it possible to find an {\em Euler tour} for the graph?'' A search
problem is: ``(input) given a graph, (output) return one
Euler tour of the graph, or ``NO'' if no such tour exists.'' A total
function problem is: ``(input) given an Euler graph, (output) return
one of its Euler tours.'' A counting problem is ``(input) given a graph,
(output) return the number of its Euler tours.''

Computational problems are also classified according to their
{\em computational complexity}, given by the {\em reducibility} from each
other.

\todo[inline]{Turing machines: here - not that in the following deterministic
TM}

Let $P_1$ be a computational problem. For an instance $x$ of $P_1$, let
$|x|$ be the the number of bits needed to encode $x$. $P_1$ {\em reduces to
the problem $P_2$ in polynomial time}, denoted $P_1\leq_P P_2$, if there
exists a {\em polynomial-time reduction}, that is, a function
$f: \{0,1\}^\ast \to \{0,1\}^\ast$ and a Turing machine $\mathcal{M}$
such that for all $x\in\{0,1\}^\ast$

\begin{enumerate}
\item $x\in P_1\quad\iff\quad f(x)\in P_2$;
\item $\mathcal{M}$ computes $f(x)$;
\item $\mathcal{M}$ stops after $p(|x|)$ steps, where $p$ is a polynomial.
\end{enumerate}

The complexity class $\mathrm{\mathbf{P}}$ contains all the
{\em polynomially decidable problems}, that is, all problems $P$ such that
there exists a Turing machine $\mathcal{M}$ that outputs either ``YES'' or
``NO''  for all inputs $x\in\{0,1\}^\ast$ of $P$ after $p(|x|)$ steps, where
$p$ is a polynomial. Intuitively, a decision problem is in
$\mathrm{\mathbf{P}}$ if the answer to its question can be found in a number
of steps that is polynomial in the input of the problem.

A problem $P$ belongs to the class $\mathrm{\mathbf{NP}}$,
{\em non-deterministic polynomial-time problems}, if there exists a
Turing machine $\mathcal{M}$ and polynomials $p_1,p_2$ such that

\begin{enumerate}
\item for all $x\in P$ there exists a {\em certificate} $y\in \{0,1\}^\ast$
which satisfies $|y|\leq p_1(|x|)$;
\item $\mathcal{M}$ accepts the combined input $xy$, stopping after at most
$p_2(|x| + |y|)$ steps;
\item for all $x\notin P$ there does not exist $y\in \{0,1\}^\ast$ such
that $\mathcal{M}$ accepts the combined input $xy$.
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively: a decision problem is in $\mathrm{\mathbf{NP}}$ if it takes
polynomial time to verify whether the ``certificate solution'' $y$ is,
indeed, a correct answer to the question posed by the problem. A problem is
in the class $\mathrm{\mathbf{co-NP}}$ if its em complement is in
$\mathrm{\mathbf{NP}}$.
The class $\mathrm{\mathbf{\# P}}$ captures the problem of counting the
number of possible certificates for a problem in $\mathrm{\mathbf{NP}}$.

\todo[inline]{Formally, $\mathrm{\mathbf{\# P}}$ is defined as...}

In \cite{megiddo-papad}

The class $\mathrm{\mathbf{FNP}}$, {\em function non-deterministic
polynomial}, is defined as the class of binary
relations $R(x,y)$ such that there is a polynomial-time algorithm that
decides whether $R(x,y)$ holds for given $x,y$ satisfying $|y|\leq p(|x|)$,
where $p$ is a polynomial. If a $y$ as above is guaranteed to exist, the
problem belongs to the class $\mathrm{\mathbf{TFNP}}$,
{\em total function non-deterministic polynomial}.
That is, $\mathrm{\mathbf{FNP}}$ and  $\mathrm{\mathbf{TFNP}}$ are analogous
to $\mathrm{\mathbf{NP}}$, but they allow for problems of (respectively)
function and total function form.
