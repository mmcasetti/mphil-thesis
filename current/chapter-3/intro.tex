In the previous chapter we have defined some problems
of the form ``find another completely labeled\ldots'' for
vertices, facets and Gale strings. In this section we
will focus on different versions of a standard algorithm, first introduced
by Lemke and Howson in \cite{lh}, that yields a solution to these problems
using two main concepts: the {\em pivoting} routine and
{\em almost complete labeled} vertices, facets and Gale strings.
