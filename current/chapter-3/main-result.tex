\section{The Complexity of \anothergale}

% proposition "enough to solve anothergale for d even": \label{d-even-anothergale}

A {\em matching} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set $M\subseteq E$ such that every
vertex $v\in V$ is the endpoint of at most one edge $m\in M$. A
{\em perfect matching} is a matching such that there is an edge $m\in M$
incident to every vertex $v\in V$.
\linebreak[5]
Edmonds \cite{edm} proved the {\bf FP}
complexity of finding a perfect matching. The result can be easily extended
to multigraphs which have parallel edges, since a perfect matching of a multigraph $G$ corresponds to
a perfect matching of the graph $G'$ obtained by ignoring all parallel edges
of $G$.

\begin{theorem}{\rm (Edmonds \cite{edm}.)}
\label{edm-thm}
It takes polynomial time to find a perfect matching of a
graph or to decide that no such matching exists.
\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
{Perfect Matching}
{A multigraph $G = (V,E)$.}
{A perfect matching for $G$, or {\sc No} if there is no possible perfect
matching for $G$.}
\label{pm-pbl}
\end{problem}

\begin{proposition}\label{pm-thm}
{\sc Perfect Matching} is in {\bf FP}.
\end{proposition}

To prove our main result on \anothergale, we will prove that the
%\linebreak[4]
related problem \gale\ can be solved in polynomial time.

\begin{problem}
{\gale}
{A labeling $l:[n]\to[d]$, where $d$ is even and $n>d$.}
{A Gale string $s\in G(d,n)$ that is completely labeled by $l$ or {\sc No}
if no such string exists.}
\end{problem}

\begin{theorem}\label{gale-thm}
\gale\ is in {\bf FP}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Recall that we consider the Gale strings $s\in G(d,n)$ as
``wrapped-around strings'', that is,
$s(n+i)=s(i)$ and $l(n+i)=l(i)$ for all~$i\in[n]$.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be the multigraph with $V=[d]$, so that the vertices of $G$
correspond to the labels $l(i)\in [d]$, and
\begin{equation}
\label{edges-graph}
E=\{\,(l(i),l(i+1))\mid i\in[n]\, \},
\end{equation}
so that there is an edge
between two vertices if and only if the corresponding labels are
next to each other at some index $i$.

Let $s\in G(d,n)$ be a completely labeled Gale string for $l$.
By the Gale evenness
condition, every run of length $k$ in $s$ corresponds uniquely to $k/2$
disjoint pairs of indices $(i,i+1)$ with $s(i)=s(i+1)=1$.
Let $M$ be the set of corresponding edges $(l(i),l(i+1))$ in~$E$.
%% does not define M clearly
% \begin{equation}
% \label{matching-graph}
% M=\{ (l(i),l(i+1))\ \mid\ s(i)=s(i+1)=1\text{ without repetitions of } i \}.
% \end{equation}
Since $s$ is completely labeled, every label $l(i)\in [d]$
occurs at exactly one of the endpoints of an edge in~$M$.
Since the there are no repetitions of $i$'s in~$M$, there is only one such
edge. Hence, $M$ is a perfect matching of~$G$.

Conversely, let $M$ be a perfect matching for $G=(V,E)$.
% as in (\ref{matching-graph}).
Let $s$ be the bitstring with $s(i)=s(i+1)$ for every
$(l(i),l(i+1))\in M$ and $s(i)=0$ otherwise.
Since $M$ is a matching, all the $(l(i),l(i+1))\in M$ are disjoint, so
every run of $s$ is of even length. Therefore $s$ satisfies the Gale
evenness condition. Furthermore, since $M$ is perfect, every
vertex $l(i)\in [d]$ is the endpoint of an edge $(l(i),l(i+1))\in M$,
therefore $s$ is completely labeled.

This proves that \gale\ reduces to {\sc Perfect Matching} in polynomial time.
By Proposition \ref{pm-thm}, Algorithm~\ref{gale-alg} takes
polynomial time to find a solution of an instance of \gale\
or to decide that no such solution exists.
\end{proof}

It is interesting to notice that the graph $G=(V,E)$ is an Euler graph,
since its edges have been defined following an Euler tour starting in $l(1)$.

\begin{example}
Consider the labeling $l_s=121314$. Figure \ref{no-matching} shows the
corresponding graph. It is easy to see that a perfect matching is not
possible.
Analogously, as we have seen in Example \ref{no-clgs},
there isn't any possible completely labeled Gale string for $l_s$.

We finally extend the proof of Theorem \ref{gale-thm} to give the complexity
\linebreak[5]
of \anothergale.

\begin{theorem}
\label{anothergale-thm}
\anothergale\ is in {\bf FP}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be the graph corresponding to the labeling
\linebreak[5]
$l:[n]\to [d]$ with $V=[d]$ and $E$ as in (\ref{edges-graph}). Let
$M_0$ be the perfect
\linebreak[5]
matching of $G$ corresponding to the completely
labeled Gale string $s_0\in G(d,n)$. % as in (\ref{matching-graph}).

Theorem \ref{lhg-works-ppad-thm} guarantees the existence of another
completely labeled Gale string $s\neq s_0$, therefore of a corresponding
perfect matching $M\neq M_0$.
Since $M\neq M_0$, there is at least one edge $e\in M_0$ such that
$e\notin M$. Consider the $d/2$ graphs $G_i=(V,E_i)$, where
$E_i=E\setminus\{ e_i \}$ for $e_i\in M_0$. Since $V(G)=V(G_i)$ and
$E(G_i)\subset E(G)$, a perfect matching $M_i$ of $G_i$
is a perfect matching for $G$ as well. We have that
$e_i\notin M_i\subset E_i$ but $e_i\in M_0$. Therefore $M_i\neq M_0$.

There are exactly $d/2$ possible $G_i$'s. By Proposition \ref{edm-thm},
finding a perfect matching or deciding that there is none takes polynomial
time for each $G_i$. Therefore, by applying Algorithm (\ref{anothergale-alg})
it is possible to find a perfect matching $M_i\neq M_0$
and the corresponding completely labeled Gale string $s\neq s_0$ in
polynomial time.

Applying Theorem \ref{galenash-to-another-gale} to
Theorem \ref{anothergale-thm} we have our main result: {\sc Gale Nash}
is in {\bf FP}, under the assumption that the construction
of the game from a cyclic polytope is given.

\begin{theorem}
\label{main-thm}
Finding a Nash equilibrium of a Gale game takes polynomial time.
