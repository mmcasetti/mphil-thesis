# Complexity of the Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract
TODO - no dates but biblio refs

## Introduction
TODO - **all**
* the usual
* mention PPAD, won't come back until appendix but it's the background

## Games, Polytopes and Gale Strings

### Games and Nash equilibria
TODO - **all**
* usual defs &tc

### Best Response Polytopes
TODO - **all**
* see articles vS & past theses

### Cyclic Polytopes and Gale strings
new outline:
* def CP
* def GS
* example GS, d even
* exmple GS, d odd
* thm Gale (true for d even and odd!)
* graphics to go w/ thm
* prop even d (use modulo, then find a nice notation & drop it)
* assume that from now on d even (unless o/w spec - if parity thm for odd d too)

TODO
* thm by Gale relating the two,
* graphics illustrating thm - see talks/arts vS
* example GS d odd
* use notation "modulo n" - then find a nice notation & drop it

DONE
* def GS
* one example GS (even)

### Labeling and the Problem ANOTHER GALE
TODO
* labeled polytopes
* & NE as compl labeled vertices
* hence def ANOTHER GALE
* ex labeled GD, d odd (?)

DONE
* def labeled GS
* ex labeled GS (d even)

## Algorithms and Complexity Results

### Pivoting
[on GS and on poly]

TODO
* rewrite **all**
* examples

### The Lemke-Howson Algorithm and Parity
[on GS and on poly]

new outline:
* almost completely labeled GS
* LH for Gale
* even no of CLGS
- holds for d odd too (?)
- not for GS in general
* examples (by pf thm that GS + label => unique, ex show that converse not true)

TODO
* rewrite **all**
* a lot of tabulars and graphics

### The Complexity of GALE and ANOTHER GALE
outline:
* GALE introduced as accessory problem
* PM def
* main thm for GALE
* ex of construction: if there is / there isn't PM
* main theorem for ANOTHER GALE
* ex: double edge / all edges in PM are single / all single edges

TODO
* edit **all**
* edit pf GALE
* edit pf ANOTHER GALE
* examples for ANOTHER GALE

## Further Results
