# Complexity of the Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

## Abstract
**DONE - all!**

## Introduction

TODO - **all**

## Complexity, Games, Polytopes and Gale Strings

### The Complexity Classes P and PPAD

TODO - **all**

### Normal Form Games and Nash equilibria

TODO - **all**

### Bimatrix Games and Best Response Polytopes

TODO - **all**

### Cyclic Polytopes and Gale strings

TODO
* thm by Gale relating the two,
* graphics illustrating thm - see talks/arts vS
* example GS d odd
* use notation "modulo n" - then find a nice notation & drop it

DONE
* def GS
* one example GS (even)

### Labeling and the Problem ANOTHER GALE

TODO
* labeled polytopes
* & NE as compl labeled vertices
* hence def ANOTHER GALE
* ex labeled GD, d odd (?)

DONE
* def labeled GS
* ex labeled GS (d even)

## Algorithms and Complexity Results

### Pivoting

TODO - rewrite **all**, with examples

### The Lemke-Howson Algorithm and Parity

TODO - rewrite **all**, with a lot of tabulars and graphics

### The Complexity of GALE and ANOTHER GALE

**DONE: all!**

*Would be nice* - in "intermediate" graph in example, first & last label
connected with "hook" edge.

## Further Results

TODO - **all**

## Appendix: a Result on the PPAD-completeness of NASH

TODO - **all**

## Appendix: Notation

[Maybe]
