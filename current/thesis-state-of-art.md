# Complexity of the Gale String Problem for Equilibrium Computation in Games

TODO: graphs not with the horrible xy-pic package but with eps + include

## Abstract
**DONE - all!**

## Introduction

TODO - **all**

## Complexity, Games, Labels, Polytopes, Strings

### Some Complexity Classes

TODO:

* Turing Machine - def
* hash-P - formal def (?)
* PPA(D) - def, example SPERNER and/or BROUWER

### Normal Form Games and Nash Equilibria

TODO:

* sketch proof Nash thm, noticing Brouwer
* ex: generalised matiching pennies, used in DGP (appendix)
* NASH from pow complexity: TFNP (obv), PPAD (sketch pf), PPAD-complete
(thm - without pf, of course, don't even mention graphical games and so on!)

### Some Geometrical Notation

TODO (as appendix? as section before this?): notation / basic definition of
polytopes

### Bimatrix Games, Labels and Polytopes

TODO: nondegenerate games

TODO: example (from SvS 2015)


### Cyclic Polytopes and Gale Strings

TODO
* thm by Gale relating the two,
* graphics illustrating thm - see talks/arts vS
* example GS d odd
* use notation "modulo n" - then find a nice notation & drop it

DONE
* def GS
* one example GS (even)

TODO
* labeled polytopes
* & NE as compl labeled vertices
* hence def ANOTHER GALE
* ex labeled GD, d odd (?)

DONE
* def labeled GS
* ex labeled GS (d even)

## Algorithms and Complexity Results

### Pivoting and the Lemke-Howson Algorithm

TODO - rewrite **all**, with a lot of tabulars and graphics

#### Exponentially Long Paths

PPAD: DGP & CD + SvS results = why ANOTHER GALE in P is important!


### The Complexity of GALE and ANOTHER GALE

TODO:

* graphs as eps included
* property --> proposition (if used)


DONE: all!

*Would be nice* - in "intermediate" graph in example, first & last label
connected with "hook" edge. Done once used eps instead of xy-pic

## Further Results

TODO - **all**

## Appendix: a Result on the PPAD-completeness of NASH

TODO - **all**

## Appendix: Notation

[Maybe]

## Biblio

*In progress*
